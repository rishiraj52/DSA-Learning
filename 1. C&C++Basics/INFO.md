<h3>While accessig heap using pointer, you must also free the space at the end. In these programs I didn't freed the pointers and it's actually not a good practice, but I suggest you to free the pointers before going ahead.
<h4>The pointers can be freed in this way:-
  <h5>
    <p>For C users - free(pointer name);</p>
    <p>For C++ users - delete pointer name;</p>
    
  <h5>Free the pointer, enjoy bug-free program.
